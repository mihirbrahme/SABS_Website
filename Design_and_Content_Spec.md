> This document captures the current structure and content of the SABS website to facilitate review and enhancement planning.

## 1. Design Note (Aesthetics & Interface)

### Design Philosophy
The website embodies a **"Modern Corporate & Trust-Driven"** aesthetic. It moves away from traditional, text-heavy accounting sites to a dynamic, tech-forward presentation. The core themes are:
-   **Trust & Authority**: Deep navy blues and clean whitespace.
-   **Modernity & Energy**: Vibrant orange accents (`#f97316`) representing the "OATS" (fresh/energetic) inspiration.
-   **Clarity**: High readability with wide spacing and structured grids.

### Visual Identity System

#### Typography
-   **Headings**: `Outfit` (Sans-serif, geometric, friendly but professional).
    -   Usage: Hero titles, section headers, button text.
-   **Body**: `Inter` (Sans-serif, highly legible).
    -   Usage: Paragraphs, lists, functional text.

#### Color Palette
-   **Primary (Foundation)**:
    -   `Deep Navy` (#0f172a) - Used for text, strong borders, potential footers.
    -   `Darker Navy` (#020617) - High contrast elements.
-   **Accent (Action)**:
    -   `Vibrant Orange` (#f97316) - Used for primary buttons, links, icons, and highlights.
    -   `Orange Hover` (#ea580c) - Interaction state.
-   **Neutrals (Canvas)**:
    -   `White` (#ffffff) - Primary background.
    -   `Cool Grey/Slate` (#f8fafc) - Secondary backgrounds (section delineation).
    -   `Slate Text` (#475569) - Main body text.

#### UI Elements
-   **Buttons**: Slightly squarer (`8px` radius) for a tech-focused feel.
    -   *Primary*: Solid Orange.
    -   *Ghost*: White with border.
-   **Cards**: Generous padding, subtle shadows (`--shadow-lg`), and rounded corners (`16px`).
-   **Icons/Bullets**: "✓" marks in orange to signify completion/compliance.
